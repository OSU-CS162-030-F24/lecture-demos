Complexity analysis: A way of analyzing / measuring the "complexities" of an
algorithm

Space complexity: A measure of how much space (memory) an algorithm takes

Runtime complexity: A measure of how much time an algorithm takes

Complexities are measures of rates of growth relative to some parameter

Example: Problem is sorting an array of N elements

Big O Notation (Big Theta Notation):

for each element x in array of size N:
	print x
O(N) -> Linear runtime complexity

Print out a multiplication table of size NxN 

for each i from 1 to N:
	for each j from 1 to N
		print i * j

Total number of elements is N * N.

The above algorithm has a runtime complexity of O(N^2)
O(N^2) -> quadratic runtime complexity

How to do runtime complexity:
1. Count the number of operations performed by the whole algorithm, relative
	to N
2. Reduce.
2.a. If your big O notation has multiple terms in it, discard all of the
	non-dominant terms

	O(N + N^2 + N^3) = O(N^3)
2.b. If your big O notation has coefficients, get rid of them!
	
	O(20N) = O(N)
2.c. If your big O notation has a logarithm term in it, discard the base

	O(log_2(N)) = O(log(N))
2.d. If your big O notation has nothing but constants, simply rewrite it as
	O(1) (constant complexity)

	O(1025) = O(1)
