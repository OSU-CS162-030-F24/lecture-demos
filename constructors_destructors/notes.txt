Constructors: A special member function that's automatically called when
	an object is declared. The purpose is to "set up" an object.
Destructors: A special member function that's automatically called when
	an object is freed / deleted. The purpose is to "tear down" an object.

The big three:
1. Destructors
2. Copy constructors
3. Assignment operator overloads (AOOs)

The purpose of the big three are to manage dynamic memory (freeing it, and
copying it)
