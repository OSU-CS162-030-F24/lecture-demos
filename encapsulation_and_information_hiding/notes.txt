Coupling: Is when you want to change one component of code, and that necessitates
changing one or more other components of code

Interface: The parts of a component that other components interact with.
	Coupling ALWAYS occurs at interfaces

Three things that we'll do with coupling:
1. Reduce it
2. Isolate it
3. Intelligently move our coupling around such that the components of code
	that are most likely to NEED to change are also subject to the LEAST
	amount of coupling

Encapsulation: Co-locate data and behavior

Information hiding: Hiding information behind a public interface
